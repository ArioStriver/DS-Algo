/*
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2

Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5

Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.


METHOD 1: (LINEAR SEARCH)

TIME: O(N).

SPACE: O(1).

            }
        
    return nums.length - 1;
      }
}

METHOD 2:(BINARY SEARCH)

TIME: O(logN).
